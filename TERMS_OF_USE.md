## Nature of the Crypto Trade Analyzer

8. The Crypto Trade Analyzer is a tool designed to provide an analysis of the overall cost and the net return (after deducting fees) in respect of executing the same order inputs on two or more centralized exchange platforms (the **"Reference Exchanges"**), including the Binance Platform, using the live order book of each Reference Exchange. The Crypto Trade Analyzer takes into account a number of factors which can impact on the overall cost of a trade, including but not limited to trading fees and order book slippage, based on publicly available information, through open source code.

9. The Crypto Trade Analyzer is to be used for reference and information purposes only. Your use of the Crypto Trade Analyzer shall not be construed as an inducement to trade on the Binance Platform over any Reference Exchange or any other platform, or to trade at all. The Crypto Trade Analyzer is not sponsored by, endorsed by or affiliated with any Reference Exchange other than the Binance Platform.

10. The Crypto Trade Analyzer provides an analysis as of the exact time the analysis is generated only.

11. We may add or remove Reference Exchanges from the Crypto Trade Analyzer at any time and for any reason. The addition, removal or omission of any exchange platform from the list of Reference Exchanges is in no way a representation of any nature in respect of that exchange platform.

12. If you make the decision to trade on the Binance Platform following your use of the Crypto Trade Analyzer, your ability to trade remains subject to you fulfilling the relevant eligibility requirements. We are under no obligation to allow you to trade on the Binance Platform if you have used the Crypto Trade Analyzer.

14. By using the Crypto Trade Analyzer, you acknowledge and agree that use of the Crypto Trade Analyzer is entirely at your own risk and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any losses, damages, liabilities, cost, claim, or expense arising from your access or use of the Crypto Trade Analyzer.

15. Neither Binance, nor any affiliate or representative of Binance, makes any representation or warranty that the Crypto Trade Analyzer is appropriate for any user or in any particular location, nor will continue to be available or appropriate for any user or in any particular location. In particular, the Crypto Trade Analyzer presents information on an "as is" basis and this information should not be construed as financial advice, investment advice, trading advice or a recommendation of any kind by Binance and you are solely responsible for your investment decisions.
